# BookeoPHP
This is PHP code that it is used to create a connection with the service Bookeo using PHP. This code is not related with anything, only is a simple class that can be used in other places.

This code is working, only is necesary to adapt to the specific use case.

This code works with dummy products ids of a couple of trial accounts that I used to create this API.
This products and the credentials don't work because all of them was created using a free trial accounts, but the idea of how the class is being used should be clear. 


If somethig doens't work, remember that this API is case sensitive. Do not have this on mind make me lost a lot of time.
Always remember that the API's can be case sensitive. 

I hope this code helps someone.
